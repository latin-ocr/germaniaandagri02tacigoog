ct the schools had iniected all the departments oi literature.
Simple narrative no longer suited the pampered teste of the
readers or the writers of history. It must hs highly seasoned ,
with sentimentalism and moraliaing‚ with romanoe and poetry.
Tacitus, certainly, did not escape the iniection. ln the lan·
guage oi Macanlay‚ “ He carries his love oi effect far beyond
tha limita of moderatior. He tells a fine story finely, but ha
cannot tell a plain story plainly. He stimulates, till stimulante
lose their power.’'* We have taken occasion in the notes te
point out not a few examplea oi rhetorical pomp, and poetical
coloring, and even needless ¹multiplication oi words, where
plainness and precision would have been much better, a'nd
which may well surprise as in a writer oi so much conciseness.
Iord Monboddo, in every able, though somewhat extravagant
critique on Tacitus, has selected numerous instanees of what
he calls the ornamentsd dry style, many oi which are so concise,
so rough, aad so broken, that he says, they do'not deserve the
name of composition, but seem rather like the raw materials oi
history, than like history itself (orig. and Prog. of lang, voi
iii. chap. la).

Still, few readers can hil to pronouncs Tacitus, as Macanlay
affirma, and sven Lord Monboddo admits him to be, the greatest
oi Latin historiam, superior to Thucydides himself in the
moral pointing oi his best narrative soenes, and in the delinea-
tion of character without a rival among historiens, with scarcely
asuperior among dramatists and novelists. The common style
of his sanative is, indeed, wandng in simplicity, and some·
times in perspicuity. He does not deal enough in the specifio
and the pictoresque,the where,the when and the how. But
when his subject comes up to the grandeur of his conceptione.
