Virgil's AEneid.
⁵ With Explanatory Notas. By HENRY S. raiaza, Professor of

¹latin in the State University of Michigan. Illustrated. 12mo,
598 pages.

The appearance of this edition of Virgil's AEneid will, it is believed,
be hailed with delight by all classical toachers. Neither expense nor
paine have beau epared to clothe the great Latin epic in a fitting dress.

The type is unusually large and distinct, and errore in the text, so an-
noying to the learner, have been carefirlly avoided. 'l'he work contains
eighty-live engravings, which delineata the usages, costumes, weapons,
arte, and mythology of the ancients nith a vividness that cau be attained
only by pictorial illustrationsss The great feature of this editionis the
scholarly and judicious commentary firmished in the appended Notes.
The author has here endeavored not to show his learning, hut to supply
euch practica] aid ae will enable the pupil to understand and appreciata
what he reads. The notes are just full enough, thoroughly explaining
the most difficult passages, while they are not so extended as to take all
labor off the pupil'c hands. Properly used, they cannot fail to impart an
intelligent acquaintance with the syntax of the language. In a word, this ·
work is commended to teuchors aa tho most elegant, accurate, interesting,
and practically useful edition of the AEneid thathee yet been published.
