Tacitus was mucatad lor the bar, and continued to plead
causes, occasionally at least, end with not a little success,
even alter he had entered upon the great business oi hie lile,
aa a writer ol history. We find references te his first, and
perhaps his last appearance, as an advocate, in the letters oi
Pliny, which are highly complimentary. The first was, when
Pliny was nineteen, and Tanites a little older (how much we
are not informed), when Tacitus distinguished himself, so as
to awahen the emulation and the envy, though notin abad
sense, oi Pliny. The lust was some twenty years later, when
Tacitus and Pliny, the tried friends ol a whole life, the brightest
ornaments ot literature and oi the iorum, were associated by
the cheiee ol the Senam, and pleaded together at the har of
' the Senatu, and in the presence of the Emperor Trajan, for
the execution oi justice upon Marius Priscus, who was
accused of mal-administration in the proconsulship of Africa.
Pliny says, that Tacitus spolie with singular gravity and
eloquenoe, and the Senatu passed a unanimous vote os appro-
bation and thanks to hoth the oratore, for the ability aud suc-
cess with which they had managed the prosecution (Plin.
Epis. ii. ll). ,

We have also the commeate of Pliny on a panegyrical

oration, which Tacitus pronounced, when consul, upon his' ·

predecessor in the consular office, Verginius Rufus, perhaps,
the most remarkable man of his age, distinguished elike as
ahere, a smtesman, and a scholar, and yet so modest or so
wiee that he repeatedly refused the effer oi the imperialpurple.
’ “Fortuna'' says Pliny, “always faithful to Verginius, reserved
lor her last lavor, such an orator to pronounee a eulogium on
such virtues. It was enough to erown the glory oi a well
spem lise'' (Plin. Epis. ii. 1).
