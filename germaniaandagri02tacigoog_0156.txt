rm Biography oi Agricola was written early in the reign ol Trajan
(which eommeneed Α U. G. 851. A. D. 98), consequently about the

' . seme time with the Germania, though perhaps somewhut luter (ci.

notes on Germania) This date is established byiniercnce from the
author's own language in the ed and the 44th sections (see notes),
In the' former, he speaks of the down oi a better day, which opened ¹

oi three months, which intervened between the adoption oi Trajan
by h'erva, and Nerva’s death (see Brotier and many others) But
