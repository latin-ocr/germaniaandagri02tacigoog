which it is heped may serve te exhibit the author in his relation
to the history, aud especially to the literature, ef hie age.

s 4. The department in which lese remaiued to be done than
any other, for the elucidatien of Tacitus, was that ef Geography,
History, and Archaeolegy. The copieee netes of Gordou aud
Murphy left litde to be desired in this liue; and these notes are
not only accessible to American scholare iu their original forms,
but have been incorporated, mere or less, inte all the college
editions. lt any peculiar merit attaches to this edition, iu this
department, it will be found iu the frequent references to such
classic authors as furnish collateral informatieu, aud iu the
illustratiou of the private life ef the Romam, by the help of such
recent werke as Becker’s Gallus. The editor has aleo been
ableto avail himself ef Sharou Turner’s History of the Anglo
Saxone, which sheds net a little hght on the manners of the
Germane.

ὃ. Many of the ablest commentarios ou the Germania and
Agricola have appeared within a comparatively recent period,
some of them remarkable examples of critical acumen aud
exegetical 'tect aud othere medela of school aud college
editions. It has been the endeaver of the editor te bring down
the literature pertainiug to Tacitus to the present time, and to
embody in small compare the most valuable results of the
labore of such recent German editors as Grimm, Giinther,
Gruber, Kieesliug, Drouke, Roth, Ruperti, aud Walther. .

’ The text ie, iu the main, that of Walther, though the other
editors just named have been consulted3 aud iu such minor
differeuces as exist between thern, Ι have not hesitated te adopt
the reading which seemed best to accord with the usage aud
genius of Tacitus, especially when sanctioued by a decided pre·
penderance of educat suffrage. Other readings have been
referred te iu the Notes, eo far as they are of any considerable
importauce, er supported by respectable audierity. Partly fer
convenience, but chiefly as 'a matter oftaste,1have ventured
to follow the German editions in dispensiug entirely with diecri
tical marks, aud iu seme peculiarities of less importauce, which
ifuot viewed with favor, it is heped. will not be judgedwitlr
