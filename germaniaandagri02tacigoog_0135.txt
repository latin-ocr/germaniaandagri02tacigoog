The following paragraph from Prichard's Researches embodiea
some citha more general conclusione ci ahaoyrapderc, especially ol
Zeum ou whom Prichard, in common with Orelli aud many other
scholare, places great ruliance. “Aloug the coest of the German
Ocean aud across the isthmus of the cimbric peninsula to the shore
ol the Baltic, were spread the tribes of thc Chauci aud lhisii, the
Anglii, Saxones and the Teutones or Jums who epoho the lou
omnen languages, and formed oue of the four divisione of the
German racc, corresponding as it seems with the Iaycecoaeacl '
Tacitus and Pliny. In thc higher and 'more centrol parts, the
second grem division of the racc, that of the Hermioraes, was spread,
the tribes of which spoke Upper or Hiytt-Gerraaa dialects Bagin-¹
ing in theWest with the country of the Sigambri ou the Rhine, aud
from that of the Cherusci and Angrivarii near the Weser aud tha
Harta this division comprehended, besides those tribes, the Chatti,
the Langobardi, the Hermunduri, the Marcomanni and Quadi, the
Lugii, and beyond the Vetula the Bastarnae, in¹ the neighborhood
of the Oarpathiau hilla Tc the eastward ond northward of the last
mentioned, near the lower course ol the Vistula and thence at least
as far as thc Pregel, were the primitive obedes oi the Goths and
their cognate tribes, who are perhaps the Idaeaoaeal’ The fourth
divisiou of Prichard embraced the Scaudinaviaus, who spoke a lau·
guage hindred to thc Germana and were usually classed with them.
‘fhoca who would examine this subject more thoroughly, will con-

who have written expressly ou the geography or the ethnography
cs Germany.
