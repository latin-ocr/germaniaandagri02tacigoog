The German editions above mentioned, together with severa·
French, English, and American werke, have not only been con·
stautly before me, but have been used with great fresiam, and
credit awardedto them accordingly. Some may think their
names should have appeared less frequently; others that they
should have received credit to a still greater extent Suffice it

them to a considerable extent, I must heve substituted something
less perfect cf my own. Had they been more copious, and
