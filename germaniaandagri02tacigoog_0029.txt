Tacitus is decidedly superior to Livy. The chametcrs ol lisy
ure distinguishehle only ss classes-the good ull very good.
the bad very bad, the indifferent very indifferent You dis-
eover no important differente between a Fabius and a Marcellus
further than it lies on the fuce of their actions. In Tacitus,
the characters are all individuale idacii stands out distinotly =

¹ irone the edmunding multitude, and not only periorms his

own proper actions, but is governed by his own pseuhar
motives. Livy places before us the statues ol heroes end
gods; Tacitus conducta us through the crowd ol living men.
ln an attempt to eketch the most striking leatures oi Tacitus,
as a writer, no critic can omit to mention his sage and pithy
maxims. Apothegms ehound on every page—sagacious, truth-
lul, and prolound in sentiment, in style concise, antithetic and
sententious. Doubtless he is excessively fond oi pointed
antithesis. Perhaps he is too much given to moralizing and
reflection. lt was‚as we have said, the fault oi his nge. But
no one, who is familiar with &neca will severely censure
Tacitus. He will only wonder that he should have risen so
tar above the laults oi his contemporaries. indeed, Tacitus
interweaves his reflectione with so much propriety, and clothes
his apotlregrns with so much dignity-he ie so manifestly cnm·
petent to instruct the world by maxims, whether in civil, social,
or indi'ridnal lile, that we are iar from wishing he had indulged
in it less. His reflectione do not interrupt the thread ol his
donativo. They grew naturally out oi his incidente. They ’
break forth spontaneously from the lips ol his men. His
history is indeed philosophy teaehing by examples; and his
pithy sayings are trnly lessons of wisdom‚ embodied in the
form most likely tc striks the attention, and impress the

memory. We should love to see a collection ol apothegnre
irem the pen oi Tacitus. It would make an admirable book
